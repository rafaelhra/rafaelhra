## 😸 About me:
- 🎓I'm an undergraduate student in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Universidade Federal da Paraíba (UFPB) - João Pessoa, PB / Brazil;
- ⚡I'm from Brazil, and I've always been curious about what can I do with programming. I like to go beyond everything I do and it makes me an excellent self-taught person. Whenever I'm not solving math lists from college or sleeping, I code some cool stuff here and there. I have a very methodical mindset, which helps me develop projects;
- 🎵 My favorite hobby is music and I like to play guitar in my free time, things like bossa-nova and classical guitar music. Also, I love reading books, and I write some ideas down when I have time. Furthermore, I love sports and competitions in general, things like running, soccer, calisthenics... whatever makes me move, I'm into it!
- 🧠 Data is my passion, and I have a goal to develop interesting things and contribute to the AI market in some way, maybe innovating with some startup or becoming a researcher in the area. I see technology as much more than just a career, but also as a cause to be fought for and to make it even more accessible, positively impacting on society's progress.

I used to have this GithHub stats section on my profile, but I decided to remove it for two reasons:
    1. I wasn't finding it pretty in my readme
    2. Everyone uses it! It's kind of saturated...
But if you want to copy it and use it, go ahead. Remember to change the username in the code to your own:
